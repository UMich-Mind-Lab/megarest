# Notes for megarest

These are some working notes for the megarest project.

## Working `conn`?

The `conn` standalone does not seem to work either from inside the
container or outside using `conn18b_glnxa64.zip` and
`MCR_R2018b_glnxa64_installer.zip` on The Linux (Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Server release 7.9).

However, using the installation of `conn` in the
`/nfs/turbo/lsa-lukehyde/MTwiNS/mri/conn` directory and the SPM12
also installed there with the Matlab -- R2019b Update 6
(9.7.0.1434023) -- does work.

That leaves open the question of what was used to run this before
and how.

## Standard procedure from video

We don't find much in the way of documentation, but there is a video
that goes over the process for doing megarest.  What follows is an
attempt at written documentation.
